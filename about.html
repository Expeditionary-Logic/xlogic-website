            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                We're a software company dedicated to creating technology for good. In an industry often driven by
                engagement metrics and data extraction, we've chosen a different path. We build software that
                respects your time, protects your privacy, and genuinely helps you accomplish your goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach is simple: technology should serve people, not exploit them. Every product we create
                is designed with intention, free from dark patterns, manipulation tactics, and unnecessary data collection.
                We believe the best software is the kind that helps you live better, learn more, and stay focused on
                what matters to you.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We're committed to proving that ethical software can thrive without compromising user trust.
                From free, ad-free applications to privacy-first design principles, everything we build reflects
                our core belief: good technology creates positive outcomes for the people who use it.
