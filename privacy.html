            <p>
                At Expeditionary Logic, we deeply respect your privacy. This isn't just a legal statement—it's a core principle
                that guides how we build our products. Our approach is simple: <strong>we don't need to collect your information,
                so we don't collect your information.</strong>

                    <h3>No Tracking</h3>
                    <p>We don't track your behavior, your location, or your usage patterns. No analytics, no cookies, no fingerprinting.</p>

                    <h3>No Third Parties</h3>
                    <p>We don't share data with third parties because we don't have any data to share. No advertisers, no data brokers, no hidden partners.</p>

            <h2>How Our Products Work</h2>
            <p>
                Our products, like Sponge, are designed to work entirely on your device. Your audiobooks, your listening progress,
                your preferences—everything stays local. We've built our technology to be powerful without being invasive.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means we can't help you recover data if you lose your device, but it also means your data is truly yours.
                We believe that's a fair trade-off for genuine privacy.

            <h2>When We Might Collect Information</h2>
            <p>
                If you contact us for support or send us feedback, we'll receive whatever information you choose to share with us
                (like your email address). We'll use that information solely to respond to you and provide support. We won't add you
                to mailing lists or use it for any other purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of our products may be distributed through third-party platforms (like the Apple App Store). Those platforms
                may collect their own data according to their privacy policies, but we don't receive any personally identifiable
                information from them.

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We'll update this policy if our practices change. But our core commitment won't change: your privacy matters,
                and we'll always choose privacy over profit.
