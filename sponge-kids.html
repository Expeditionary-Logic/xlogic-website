            <h2>Designed for Children</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Sponge is designed to be used by kids.</strong> We believe children deserve access to the vast
                world of public domain literature and audiobooks, but in a way that keeps them safe and gives parents peace of mind.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                Every decision we make about content availability is guided by one principle: creating a safe,
                age-appropriate listening experience for young users.

                    <h3>🛡️ Content Filtering</h3>
                    <p>Sponge connects to Librivox, which has over 20,000 free audiobooks. While most of this content is
                    appropriate for all ages, some books may not be suitable for children.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>🚫 Automatic Blocking</h3>
                    <p>We automatically filter out Librivox books tagged with the "Erotica" genre. These books are
                    silently unavailable in Sponge—they simply won't appear in search results or browsing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>🔍 Ongoing Protection</h3>
                    <p>If other content is later determined to be inappropriate for children, it will also be filtered
                    out of Sponge. We continuously review and update our content protections.</p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; color: #333;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    We recognize that some users might want uncensored access to all public domain books available
                    through Librivox. We respect those opinions and understand the desire for unrestricted access to
                    public domain literature.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    However, <strong>Sponge is designed for children</strong>, and that means we've decided to remove
                    the possibility of accessing certain content through our app. This is a deliberate choice to
                    prioritize child safety over comprehensive access.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    We believe this approach gives parents confidence that their children can explore audiobooks
                    independently while staying within age-appropriate boundaries.
